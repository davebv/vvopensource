this application demonstrates VVCrashReporter's ability to send crash log data to a remote server.

it WILL NOT WORK unless you:

1)- install the "serverSideCrashReporter.php" file on a server.

2)- read and follow the instructions in "serverSideCrashReporter.php"

3)- modify line 12 of "AppController.m" in the "CrashReporterTestApp" target of this project so the 
	uploadURL of the VVCrashReporter instance is the address of "serverSideCrashReporter.php" on 
	your server (you want the test app to send the data to your server).  you'll have to recompile 
	the app after making this change...

As a side note, the "crash" button in this application won't work if you launch it from xcode (it 
trips the debugger instead of producing a crash log, which is the intended effect).
